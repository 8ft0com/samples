# Policy Document - Annotated Reference Template

This annotated policy template aims to provide a comprehensive reference model for authoring robust security and compliance policies aligned with industry best practices.

**Purpose**

The key rationale behind this template is to help organizations overcome challenges in developing policies that are often inconsistent, lacking in detail, or not actionable by staff and systems. By covering policy elements extensively and including both intention and rationale statements, the template facilitates authoring detailed policies with context.

**Applicability**

While the template uses security policy for illustration, the structure and guidelines are domain-agnostic and applicable for all policy types like accessibility, ethics, sustainability etc. The annotations guide subject matter experts in customizing the template for specific organizational needs.

**Audience**

The template serves as a valuable tool for:

- Policy authors and governance teams crafting new policies
- Security engineers and architects implementing policy requirements
- Auditors evaluating the completeness of policy frameworks

**Extensibility**

As policies must evolve continually to address emerging risks, new sections can be added to the template to meet unforeseen needs. References to related standards and regulations should be kept updated.

By incorporating the template early in the policy authoring lifecycle, organizations can overcome many common policy gaps through proactive design thinking rather than reactive fixes. Detailing not just the "what" but the "why" of policy clauses enables systematic, contextual policy management.
